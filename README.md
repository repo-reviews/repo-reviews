### Mission
#### *Increase productivity and success in the GitHub community with a transparent, trusted forum that publishes user experiences.*

### Why?

*GitHub repos don’t include stories of user experiences.*

*Sharing these stories can avoid rabbit-holes and save time, greatly increasing productivity across the community.*

## Getting started

Becoming a 🚀 reviewer takes 🤓, ❤️, and 💪.

The best reviews share insights that are not widely known by the majority of the community, but that would **save them hours of work to discover**.

For instance, not many people need to know that [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) is a great JavaScript runtime and that it is easy to set up.  Is there something about a particular implementation that you have discovered through experience that would help the community?  Perhaps there's an alternative, or a configuration that works well... or doesn't.

**Note:** an *experience* is not an *issue* (*issues* should be reported via a repo's **/issues** endpoint).

A **good place to start** is by reviewing [trending repositories that are under active development](https://github.com/trending).


## Contributing
