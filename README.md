### Hi there, welcome to Repo Reviews 👋

| [Project Source](https://github.com/repo-reviews/repo-reviews.github.io) | [Website](https://repo-reviews.github.io) | [Create a review](https://github.com/repo-reviews/repo-reviews.github.io/blob/main/create.md) |

Support the community with a helpful ❤️ [repo review](https://github.com/repo-reviews/repo-reviews.github.io/blob/main/create.md) ❤️

### Mission
#### *Increase productivity and success in the GitHub community with a transparent, trusted forum that publishes user experiences.*

### Why?

*GitHub repos don’t include stories of user experiences.*

The purpose of reviews is not to flag issues, but share UX stories.  For example:
- a repo could be working as intended, but might not be a suitable fit for a particular user, stack, or implementation
- a repo could be losing momentum, core team moved on, or have other development meta-issues that would be helpful sharing
- particularly critical issues are `wontfix` or `not planned` or on a long-term dev roadmap
- multiple repos could be attempting to achieve the same goal, the process of comparing repos can be very time-consuming

💡 In these cases, it can **save a person, team, or company hours, if not days** of work to read through reviews.

Hence a tool for sharing UX stories in an independent, transparent, and centrally-located repo.  

*Sharing UX stories can avoid rabbit-holes and save time, greatly increasing productivity across the community.*

## Getting started

Becoming a 🚀 reviewer takes 🤓, ❤️, and 💪.

The best reviews share insights that are not widely known by the majority of the community, but that would **save them hours of work to discover**.

For instance, not many people need to know that [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) is a great JavaScript runtime and that it is easy to set up.  Is there something about a particular implementation that you have discovered through experience that would help the community?  Perhaps there's an alternative, or a configuration that works well... or doesn't.

Great reviews often result from the ✨ in: 😓😓😓❤️😓😓😓💪😓😓😓✨✨🤓🚀

**Note:** an *experience* is not an *issue* (*issues* should be reported via a repo's **/issues** endpoint).

A **good place to start** is by reviewing [trending repositories that are under active development](https://github.com/trending).
